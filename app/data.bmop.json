            "The Boston Modern Orchestra Project (BMOP) is one of the few professional orchestras in the United States dedicated exclusively to performing and recording music of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Their stated mission is to explore the evolution of the music formerly known as classical.",
            "BMOP commissioned this site redevelopment with two primary needs in mind. First, they had managed their ticketing and sales office by hand and really needed to streamline that process. Secondly, they had a huge amount of archived content they wished to share.",
            "I took advantage of Drupal's excellent Ubercart module to build BMOP's online storefront. Other modules helped me quickly construct a site where each piece of content is tightly integrated with the others, creating a product that increased BMOP's capacity while showcasing their impressive collection of material."
